# Why web3?

### Differences between traditional SMTP, Web 2.0, and eb3

In traditional letter greetings, the medium's nature inherently proves that the sender has spent economic costs and time, providing a sense of formality by mutually confirming that both parties are aware of each other at that moment. On the other hand, in SMTP and Web 2.0, sending messages instantly and for free has become the norm, resulting in the loss of this formality. Furthermore, SMTP and Web 2.0 protocols cannot include payments without third-party vendors, making it difficult to supplement formality by incurring economic costs.

While it is possible to send 1-to-N greetings on social media timelines, such greetings do not allow for the mutual confirmation that both parties are aware of each other at that moment. Therefore, we do not consider them as essential greetings. In this discussion, we will focus on 1-to-1 greetings.

### Why web3 is Appropriate

While there are examples in Web2.0 where formality was supplemented by making messages paid within the service, the data remained confined within the service, leading to competition and fragmentation of users. This would require users to switch between different apps depending on the recipient, making it inconvenient. Since greetings are a fundamental human desire, it is better to have a public protocol or public infrastructure like email.

With the proliferation of public blockchains, it has become possible to integrate payments into the protocol without relying on third-party providers. Additionally, the concept of web3, where data is not confined within a vendor but is publicly managed by individuals, has gained traction. Activity histories associated with web3 accounts can now be accessed by anyone.

In other words, if we can create a web3 greeting protocol that integrates payments and keeps data constantly public, it will not only be easy to send but also supplement formality. The utilization of the greeting graph will promote serendipity in human relationships, and anyone will be able to create their client apps via smart contracts. Of course, the content of the greeting will remain secret, as explained later. What will be publicly available on the blockchain as a greeting graph are only the header information, which consists of the recipient's web3 account and the sender's web3 account addresses. Users can control this by using multiple accounts, or they can cleverly hide and quote it using zero-knowledge proofs, which we consider acceptable.

Based on the above, it is appropriate to build a web3 greeting protocol. As the web3 greeting protocol is uncharted territory, we will develop it from scratch.
