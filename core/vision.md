# Vision

People need triggers to take action. In the reference implementation of the client app, the greeting graph is analyzed to determine who sent greetings to whom. The app then suggests sending greetings to people who have close relationships but haven't greeted each other yet, aiming to promote serendipity in social interactions. Moreover, since greetings are a fundamental human activity, it's better if they can be done more easily, regardless of whether the medium has shifted from paper to electronic data.&#x20;

Ultimately, we aim for major platforms such as operating systems to release first-party apps implementing "The Greeting." If the recipient can be identified from contact lists, our goal is to enable sending easy, formal greetings with just a couple of clicks, even if it's paid.&#x20;

Additionally, we hope that the activity history data from "The Greeting" becomes a significant criterion for evaluating the credibility of web3 accounts.
