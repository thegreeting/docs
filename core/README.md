Many people want online communication to be a comfortable and enjoyable experience. Additionally, random encounters and trustworthy accounts can enrich our lives. This project proposes a new way to easily exchange formal greetings on the internet. The history of these greetings can be used as open data to demonstrate the trustworthiness of an account.

Nowadays, instant and free communication can increase stress on both sides, as the recipient may feel pressured to acknowledge the sender. For example, when greeting someone for the first time through email, you might need to write a long, polite message to prove it's not spam. However, the recent popularity of public blockchains and the concept of web3 have returned data sovereignty to citizens and enabled payments within protocols. Additionally, zero-knowledge proof technology allows anonymous data storage. This has created an environment where a new paid greeting protocol, combining formality and efficiency, can be accepted to enhance human relationships. Moreover, there have been increasing efforts to evaluate credibility based on the activity history of public web3 accounts.

The goal of this project is to provide a new way to easily and affordably exchange greetings through an open protocol, allowing people to connect more casually. We aim to operate as a non-profit organization, maintaining transparency and accessibility while working towards becoming a social infrastructure. The greeting history can also be used to demonstrate the credibility of an account, helping to reduce trolling and defamation on the internet.

The ultimate goal is to increase random encounters and foster active communication by making it easier for people to exchange greetings. The more accessible greetings become, the better. We aim for major platforms to release dedicated clients, like an app in Japan that lets you send New Year's cards with just two taps from your smartphone's contact list. Lastly, we hope the greeting history data becomes widely adopted as a way to measure the credibility of web3 accounts.
